# in this example we are going to use variables 
# first we can create two variables named num1 and num2 
# and we will store two values on these two variable 
# num1 = 300 
# num2 = 230
# sum = num1+num2
#########
# in C,C++ and Java before a variable is going to be used , 
# declare that variable means we have to specify the type of variable.
###But in Python , playing with variable is simple . Becoz we dont have to decalre it .
###In python dynamic declaration is used .

num1 = 300
num2 = 230

sum = num1+num2 #sum

print "num1 + num2 = ",sum
